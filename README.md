#  Elastic Collection of Products🤷‍♀️😃😎🤞👌

In this project, I implemented an Elastic collection of a given object called Products.
Here a Product has: **An Id, Name, Quantity, Price, Category, OrderCount.**

My end-users or  clients want the flexibility of specifying what properties to display when listing the products,
 e.g when properties are not specified, all properties of the products are listed like:

**Id, Name, Quantity, Price, Category, OrderCount**😎

1, Dell Xps, 30, $1500, PCs, 1000
2, Ergonomic Chair, 400, $200, Chairs, 4000
3, Table, 500, $250, Tables, 3000

Lets Assume that the client specifies properties like **Name, quantity,OrderCount:**

**Name, Quantity, OrderCount**😃🤷‍♂️

Dell Xps, 30, 1000
Ergonomic Chair, 400, 4000
Table, 500, 3000


Note: In this project, i am using an  **ExpandoObject** to achieve the filtering at runtime.✌👓
